- ## Step 1
    This step involved forking the main repository from the website and forking it into my own. 

    Steps followed:
    - Forked the repository to [arnavxkohli/Lab1-Counter](https://github.com/arnavxkohli/Lab1-Counter).
    - Cloned the repository to the path: **/Documents/iac** on my local system.

- ## Step 2
    The next step was to open VS Code and find the **Task1** directory (where this readme is stored).

---
- ## Step 3
    After VS Code was opened in the directory for the task to be implemented, I created the file **counter.sv** which contains the synthesizable **System Verilog** code for the counter. The module **counter** implements the counter required for this task.

    The code for the counter was implemented as shown by the module shown above.
